==== Heading Capitalization

In https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/246 we decided to use title case for all headings:

* capitalize: first and last word, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs
* lowercase: articles and prepositions

When in doubt, opt for https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/[Chicago Style].

==== Bullet Point Lists

To unify upper/lowercase within the (EN) version, we use the _Chicago manual of style proposal_":

* short bullet items don't get a full-stop
* next one starts lowercase
* if bullets are phrases or fragments, dont use punctuation
* if and only if an item is a really long sentence which deserves a full stop, or consists of several sentences, then we use it.
* Only then does an item start with uppercase.

For the German (DE) version, we don't use punctuation at the end of bullet-list items, unless on ends-of-sentences.
