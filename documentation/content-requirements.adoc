==== What Constitutes _Good Learning Goals_

The following requirements should be fulfilled by every learning goal, especially for all R1-goals:

Specific and Clear:: 
  Each learning goal should be clear and specific, avoiding vagueness. 
This means stating what the learner will know or be able to do in precise terms. 
For software architects, this could involve specifying particular architectural styles, patterns, methods and practices they will need to learn and apply.

Relevant:: 
  Learning goals should be directly relevant to the roles and responsibilities of software architects. 
  This means they should focus on skills and knowledge that are directly applicable to designing, evaluating, and managing software architecture. 
  Relevance also includes ensuring that the goals are aligned with current industry standards, technologies, and practices to prepare learners for real-world challenges.

Authoritative:: 
  Learning goals should be based on established content, industry best practices, and proven research. 
  They should begrounded in established knowledge and industry practices.
  This ensures that the curriculum is aligned with recognized standards and that students are learning concepts that are widely accepted and validated in the field of software architecture.
  Where possible and adequate, authorative sources shall be referenced.

Measurable::
  Goals must be measurable so that both the learner and the educator can assess progress. This involves defining criteria for success, which can be quantified or qualified. For instance, a learning goal might include being able to design a complete software architecture that meets defined performance metrics or adhering to specific architectural principles.

Achievable::
  While learning goals should be challenging, they must also be attainable within the scope of the course or program. This requires considering the learners' current skill levels and the resources available to support their learning. Goals that are too ambitious may discourage learners, while those that are too easy may not lead to significant learning or skill development.
