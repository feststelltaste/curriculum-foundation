# 004: Add Authorative References to (all) R1 LGs

## Status: Proposed / Accepted

## Context 
Content of _good_ learning goals shall always be backed by authorative references, like well-known and established textbooks, websites and/or research.

## Rationale:

Having accepted references for specific content will

- facilitate creation of examination questions.
- facilitate content creation for trainers or training organizations, as they can rely on specific semantics for such content.
 
## Consequences:

- Our list of references might have to be enhanced or amended by new resources.
- The FOUNDATION-working group needs to reach consensus on what counts as "well-known and established".
- Participants won't be able to acquire and/or read all references.

### Potential Problems with _Established_ References

_Established_ in one part of the world does not imply such a reference is known or accepted in other parts.
