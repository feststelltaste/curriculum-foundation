We follow a standardized update and release process for the curriculum and the associated examination questions.

Please note the semantics of several terms:

Version-Identifier::
    Official versions of the curriculum are identified using a specific version-string.
    `V-{Release-Year}-{Update}-{Language}-{timestamp}`, for example V-2023.1-EN.
    In preparation for releases (see below), release-candidates are produced and labelled with RC1, RC2 etc.

Revision::
  In case of typos or other minor grammatical changes, we will release revisions (aka patches) without increasing the minor version. 
  They will be tagged as revisions (e.g. `2021.1-rev2``) on GitHub and receive a new timestamp, resulting in a version in a document that looks like this: `2021.1-EN-20210502`` (revision update on Mai 2, 2021).
We strive to keep learning content and structure stable across such updates, meaning that no training provider needs to adjust training material in case of revision updates.

Update::
    In case of  errors or omissions (e.g. translation issues, required updates for certain references, clarification of certain wordings or similar), an updated (aka _fixed_ or _repaired_) version of the curriculum is produced.
    For such updates we increase the second part (minor version id) of the curriculum (e.g. going from `2021.1` to `2021.2`).

Release::
    Every two years the FLWG releases a new version of the curriculum. 
    Releases usually contain major changes to the content of the curriculum.
    For example, learning goals might be re-formulated, deleted or new content might be added.
    

[IMPORTANT] 
.Releases impact training material
==== 
_Releases_ will impact structure and content of training material. 
Therefore, training providers, translation agencies and the examination commission will be notified about these releases, so they can adjust their trainings, translations or the exam questions, respectively.
====

If you <<build, build>> the curriculum locally, the version string will be set to `local build`.

=== New major versions of the curriculum
* Announcements: major versions (2019.x, 2021.x) are announced to training providers at least 3-4 month in advance--usually at the iSAQB members meeting.
* RC1: About 4-6 month prior to release, training providers receive the first release candidate (RC1) for review and comments.
* RC2: 6-8 weeks prior to release they receive the final release candidate RC2, which is _feature frozen_ (meaning neither learning goals nor priorities will substantially change, only bugs and typos will be fixed).
* Final version (e.g. 2021.1) will be made public on iSAQB.org and iSAQB.com
* Released versions will be tagged in git.

All languages (e.g. DE and EN) will be released at the same time.
